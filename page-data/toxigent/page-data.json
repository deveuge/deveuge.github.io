The information is collected by a self-developed web scraper <a href=\"https://github.com/deveuge/poisonous-plants-scraper\">Poisonous Plants Scraper</a>, built with <a href=\"https://pptr.dev\">Puppeteer</a>, which gathers information about poisonous plants for pets and saves the data in JSON format.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://toxigent.netlify.app\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/See%20demo-00C7B7?style=for-the-badge&#x26;logo=netlify&#x26;logoColor=white\" alt=\"See demo\"></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"features\">Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Homepage that lists all poisonous plants to dogs and cats and lets you filter and/or order them by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Common or scientific name.</li>\n<li>Toxicity level: all, moderate or severe.</li>\n<li>Plant type: all, house plant, garden plant or wild plant.</li>\n<li>Toxicity: all, toxic to dogs, non-toxic to dogs, toxic to cats, non-toxic to cats.</li>\n<li>Show only plants that contain detailed info: if this option is marked, only plants that contain data in “detailedInfo” will be displayed.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use of <a href=\"https://material-table.com/\">material-table</a> to display all plants in a table that offers the following functionality:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ordering by table headers.</li>\n<li>Custom action that allow the user to navigate to the detail of each plant.</li>\n<li>Export option to download the data in CSV or PDF format.</li>\n<li>Possibility to switch to night mode, that swaps the light palette to one darker.</li>\n<li>Possibility to navigate to the detail of a random plant.

The application loads this file at startup only once and then uses it to display the requested information to the user.</li>\n<li>No additional frontend libraries are contemplated to build the web interface as they are considered unnecessary in the case of a Single Page Application. That is why only CSS grid and flexbox are used to make a responsive design that displays correctly on all screens.</li>\n</ul>","tableOfContents":"<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"/toxigent/#toxigent\">Toxigent</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/toxigent/#features\">Features</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/toxigent/#technical-aspects\">Technical aspects</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Toxigent","description":"React web application built to display the data collected by a self-made web scraper, Poisonous Plants Scraper, about poisonous plants to pets.","images":["img/projects/toxigent-00.png","img/projects/toxigent-01.png","img/projects/toxigent-02.png"],"codePreview":"https://github.com/deveuge/toxigent","livePreview":"https://toxigent.netlify.app","tags":["React","Web Scraper","Pupeteer"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/toxigent/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/chart-integration/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Chart Integration"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/kingsmarch/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Kingsmarch"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
